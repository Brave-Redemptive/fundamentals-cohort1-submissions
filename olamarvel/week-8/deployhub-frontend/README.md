# Live demo

The live frontend is deployed on Vercel:
[https://deployhub-nine.vercel.app/](https://deployhub-nine.vercel.app/)

Note: the backend is hosted separately so the first API request can take a moment.

# Observability and analytics

The frontend performs lightweight readiness checks so you can actually measure things when users show up.

What it does

* Pings `/health-check` for readiness checks
* Optionally can scrape `/metrics` if you enable it
Add this to `.env.local` at the root of the frontend repo:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

This variable is used by the client to:

* make auth and data requests
* perform health checks
* optionally poll or reference `/metrics`

# Project overview

PulseTrack frontend is the UX for a health monitoring app that manages activities, appointments, and doctors. It focuses on solid auth flows, protected routes, and a responsive, accessible UI.

# Features implemented

* Authentication UI

  * Login and register pages
  * Axios interceptor that refreshes access tokens automatically
  * Persistent sessions
* Protected routes for Activities, Doctors, and Appointments
* Activities module: create, list, view details
* Doctors module: list, add, view details
* Appointments module: schedule, list, view details
* Observability integration: readiness ping, optional metrics, client-side login events
* Responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS
* Swiper.js for carousels and interactive components
* "Coming soon" placeholders for future features like Meals

# Technology stack
